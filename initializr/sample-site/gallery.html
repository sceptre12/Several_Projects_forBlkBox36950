<h2>Here are a few tips on surviving your first year</h2>
<p>Now that you have started your academic journey here at FlU, you will learn that is it important to balance your social and your scholastic lives, and understand how important it is to: Get organized. Attend all your classes. Get advised early in every semester and avoid the last minute rush. Manage your time well and make room for homework, social activities, work and most importantly time to study. Do not procrastinate. Use available resources such as the library, tutors, workshops, etc. When in doubt, ASK an Academic Advisor. They are here to guide you to success. Remember, to be good academic standing, you need to maintain a Grade Point Average (CPA) above a 2.0.While focusing on your academics, you also need to get involved on campus, as this is an important part of your education. There are numerous programs to choose from, such as Invitational Scholars, National Student Abroad or Education Abroad. If those are not your interest, you can visit Campus Life to find out about all the other activities that are available.College is a stepping stone to your future, remember to have fun, stay focused and enjoy your education!</p>

<li>What You Need to Know During the Beginning of the Semester<ol class="innerList">
<li><a class="topLink">Things Freshman Students Say Before their First Semester</a><div class="pan_inner">
<p>Things Freshmen say before their first semester</p>
<ul>
<li>I can write papers the night before and get A's and B's. It won't work in college because the expectations are higher.</li>
<li>My (fill in the blank) can talk with the professor and "fix" things if I get in trouble in a class. It won't work in college. You are responsible now.</li>
<li>If I miss a test or turn in an assignment late, I can make it up. In college, this may not be the case. The professor has the final word on late work, so read his or her syllabus carefully.</li>
<li>Cheating seemed okay in high school and if someone got caught nothing much happened. In college, you will probably get an "F" in the class and might even be suspended or dismissed from the University depending on the circumstances.</li>
<li>I don't really have to do too much homework. In college, the workload will be more than you even thought possible. If you don't keep up, good luck!</li>
<li>I've known exactly what I want to major in since 10th grade. Really? Most freshmen change their mind at least once in their first year of college.</li>
<li>I've worked 30 hours a week and still received good grades. You can do this in college too if you do nothing but go to work, study and attend classes.</li>
<li>I want all my classes between 9:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. Classes in college are offered at all times of the day and night, including weekends. You will not always find classes you need at the time you want them.</li>
<li>I don't want to take too many hard classes. Hey, they're all hard classes and you probably need them for that major you've wanted since 10th grade (now you know one of the reasons freshmen change their minds about majors.)</li>
<li>I'm undecided and I don't want any hard classes yet. They are all hard classes and most freshmen are undecided. Contact Career Services for some additional guidance about areas that might interest you.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Freshmen 411</p>
<ul>
<li>Freshmen and Seniors register first!</li>
<li>You need a Personal Identification Number (PIN) available at orientation or from the Registrar's Office, and your social security number to register.</li>
<li>Make sure you show your academic advisor any transfer, dual enrollment credits, &amp;/or AP scores.</li>
<li>Build a file/folder to keep all of your academic and university documents together. Bring this to every advising session.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li><a class="topLink">The University CORE curriculum</a><div class="pan_inner">
<p>The Heart of the University CORE Curriculum (UCC): The Dos and Don'ts!</p>
<p>DOs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get advised each semester to make sure you are following the University Core Curriculum.</li>
<li>Attempt to complete a few UCC classes each semester</li>
<li>Take UCC classes for letter grades.</li>
<li>Keep track of which UCC courses you have taken, as well as the grades you have earned in them.</li>
<li>Keep copies of all of your FIU advising/university documents.</li>
<li>Be sure to take UCC courses here at FIU.</li>
<li>Fill out the Intended Major form once you have earned 30 credits, completed a majority of the UCC requirements, and have a minimum overall GPA of 2.0 or above (higher for some majors).</li>
</ul>
<p>DON'TS</p>
<ul>
<li>Randomly pick courses, expecting that they will count towards the UCC ; they MUST be the classes that are specified on the UCC sheet to count for the CORE requirement.</li>
<li>Take two UCC English, Mathematics, or Gordon Rule writing courses in the same semester.</li>
<li>Take classes at other institutions and expect them to transfer back to FIU as UCC classes; once you start the UCC at FIU you must finish it at FIU.</li>
</ul>

<li><a class="topLink">Student Responsibilities</a><div class="pan_inner">
<p>Student Responsibilities</p>
<ul>
<li>Get advised every semester</li>
<li>Avoid the rush and make your appointment early to get advised for the next semester. If you are in the First Year Experience course, your class might have an academic advisor come in for advising during one of your class sessions. Ask your instructor.</li>
<li>Register for appropriate classes</li>
<li>Intend and declare your major</li>
<li>Maintain your academic Grade Point Average (GPA) for successful completion of your coursework and graduation!</li>
</ul>
<p>Advice</p>
<ul>
<li>Budget your time - make room for work, social activities and, most importantly, your study time in your schedule.</li>
<li>Use all available resources - library, kiosks, web site, teachers, tutors, workshops, etc.</li>
<li>Read the Undergraduate Catalog (found in the Office of Admissions) especially pages 1-47!</li>

<p>COLLEGE PREPARATORY REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>The Florida Department of Education (DOE) has determined a minimum set of SAT/ACT scores for all students attending Florida universities. If your scores are below these minimums in one or more of these areas, you are required to fulfill additional course work in the appropriate areas at a community college during your first twelve credits of enrollment at Florida International University (FIU). Failure to adhere to and fulfill these requirements will prevent you from registering at FIU in future semesters.</p>

<p><strong>ACADEMIC BLUES <br> DO YA HAVE THE ACADEMIC BLUES? </strong></p>

<p>Here are some things you can do if your grades are suffering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make an appointment to see an academic advisor to try and figure out why you are having trouble.</li>
<li>Cut down on work hours so you can increase your study time.</li>
<li>Assess your study habits and make adjustments if necessary.</li>

<li><a class="topLink">Dropping and Adding Classes/DR deadlines</a><div class="pan_inner">
<p><strong>Dropping a Class</strong></p>
<p>Be sure to mark your calendar for the drop deadline date. This is important because this allows you to drop a course (because you are failing it or struggling in it) with a DR on your transcript rather than a low grade. A DR will not affect your GPA, but a low grade will. Check the The FIU Academic Calendar web site for this particular date and remember it!</p>

<li><a class="topLink">Academic Warning/Probation and the Dean's List/Honors College</a><div class="pan_inner">
<p><strong> ACADEMIC WARNING AND PROBATION</strong></p>
<p>If you have been placed on academic warning or probation, meet with an advisor to look over your options and begin working on the next semester's schedule that will be successful for you. Begin to strategize which courses to do a Forgiveness Policy on, which courses to re-take, and ways to improve your GPA. You won't be able to register for next semester's classes until you meet with an advisor to lift your WP and UC holds.</p>
<p><strong>DEAN'S LIST</strong></p>
<p>Any fully admitted undergraduate student who earns a semester average of 3.5 or higher on nine or more semester credit hours of coursework, for which grade points are earned, is placed on the semester Dean's List. This achievement is noted on the student's semester report of grades and permanent academic record (transcript).</p>
<p><strong> HONORS COLLEGE</strong></p>
<p>The Honors College provides an opportunity for students to get the most out of their undergraduate experience. Their immediate association with a small group of students and teachers with similar capabilities and aspirations make the transition into higher education easier. The undergraduate experience is enhanced significantly by the broad liberal arts focus of the curriculum. From the first day on campus the opportunities to work closely with experienced faculty, and the opportunity for graduate and professional study, are greatly expanded for students because of the range of activities and experiences made available.</p></div>

<li><a class="topLink">Choosing a Major</a><div class="pan_inner">
<p><strong>Choosing a Major, Pursuing a Career</strong></p>
<p>Within the first 30-36 credits you will complete the General Core Curriculum, which allows you to explore different subject areas as possible majors. Once the Core Curriculum is complete it is important to have a general idea of what area to pursue because you may be able to begin taking courses in the major. Use the following steps to help you determine an area of interest for a major:</p>
<p><strong>I. Know Yourself</strong></p>
<p>Career Planning is a serious process which will take a bit of time to evaluate your values, interests, aptitudes, abilities, personal traits, and desired life style. Resource to help with this: <a href="http://www.fiu.edu/%7Ecareer/student/explore/assessment.html">http://www.fiu.edu/%7Ecareer/student/explore/assessment.html</a>Career Services (GC 230): Speak with a Career Counselor about using SIGI+ which is a career assessment tool.</p>
<p><strong>Narrow down your options</strong></p>
<p>Get a list of all the majors offered at FIU (visit the website below, or use the FIU course catalog). Eliminate all the majors you would NOT want to pursue based on information from Sec. I. List the areas you are considering. <br> Helpful resource: <a href="http://admissions.fiu.edu/downloads/majors.pdf">http://admissions.fiu.edu/downloads/majors.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>III. Limitations </strong></p>
<p>Make a note of any limitations within each major that may affect your decision. Majors such as Architecture, Interior Design, Biology, Chemistry, and Engineering need to be started as soon as possible because they require a strict, and sequential, regiment of courses. <br> Some majors have GPA requirement of above 2.0 to apply/declare (see dept.) For example: <br> Education 2.5 Business (except Accounting) 2.25 <br> Accounting 2.5 Nursing 3.0 Social Work 2.5/p&gt;</p>
<p><strong>IV. Establish a list of possible majors and do some research.</strong></p>
<p>Helpful Resources:</p>
<ol class="innerList">
<li>FIU Course Catalog: look up the requirements for each major in the catalog.</li>
<li>Individual Depts.: Speak with an advisor/faculty member in the dept.</li>
<li>Career Services Website: <a href="https://career.fiu.edu/">Career Service</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Contact someone in the field/s you are considering and conduct an informational interview to get first hand information about the nature of the job/s.</p>
<p>Consult the Occupational Outlook Handbook: <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh/">Occupational Outlook Handbook</a></p>
<p>What do I do with a major in..? Information at this site will be helpful: <a href="http://www.fiu.edu/%7Ecareer/student/explore/resources/bymajor.html">http://www.fiu.edu/%7Ecareer/student/explore/resources/bymajor.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Once you determine your major, see your Academic Advisor</strong> (PC 249/ACI 180).</p></div>

<li>You should be advised before you can register. Make an appointment early in the semester to be advised for the following semester. Note: As the registration period approaches, opportunities for advising appointments decrease.</li>
<li>It is mandatory for all Freshmen, students on Warning/Probation, College Preparatory students, Athletes and new Transfers to be advised.</li>
<li>Your access dates and times for registration will be available the week before registration at the kiosks or at the Registrar's website. Again, check the FIU academic calendar website for these dates: <a href="http://registrar.fiu.edu/index.php?id=88">OneStop FIU</a></li>
<li>After registering for your classes you can make adjustments to your schedule up until the end of the first week of classes. Check the above FIU academic calendar website for this exact date.</li>
<li>Make certain you print out, and keep hard copies of any adds and drops processed over the phone and/or via the web. There are kiosks around campus that provide access to the registration system and print outs of your schedule.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Registration Highlights for Summer School Enrollment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>During the summer, FIU offers three summer terms for summer school enrollment. There is term A (the first 6 weeks of the summer term), term B (the last 6 weeks of the summer term), and term C (the entire summer term - approximately 12 weeks).</li>
<li>Six credits during terms A and B is considered a very full schedule. Between nine and twelve credits during term C only is considered a good schedule. If you are restricted to full time status during the summer because of financial aid, scholarship, or housing reasons, check with them first to find out what is considered full-time status by their standards. Full time status according to the Registrar is 12 credits throughout the entire summer semester.</li>
<li>Each summer term (A, B, and C) have different dates for tuition deadlines, late registration fees, last day to Drop/Add, last day to Drop a class, etc. Refer to the FIU Academic calendar for these specific dates - THEY ARE IMPORTANT!<br> <a href="http://registrar.fiu.edu/index.php?id=88">OneStop FIU</a></li>
<li>Classes offered during the summer may be limited, so plan accordingly. Check the interactive course schedule on line for class availability, and remember to get advised early so that you can plan your work schedule and vacation around your summer classes. <a href="https://pslinks.fiu.edu/psc/cslinks/EMPLOYEE/CAMP/c/COMMUNITY_ACCESS.CLASS_                   SEARCH.GBL&amp;FolderPath=PORTAL_ROOT_OBJECT.HC_CLASS_SEARCH_GBL&amp;Is                   Folder=false&amp;IgnoreParamTempl=FolderPath,IsFolder">https://pslinks.fiu.edu/psc/cslinks/EMPLOYEE/CAMP/c/COMMUNITY_ACCESS.CLASS_ SEARCH.GBL&amp;FolderPath=PORTAL_ROOT_OBJECT.HC_CLASS_SEARCH_GBL&amp;Is Folder=false&amp;IgnoreParamTempl=FolderPath,IsFolder</a></li>

<li><a class="topLink">Your Your Panther Degree Audit (PDA) Report</a><div class="pan_inner">
<ul>
<li>A Panther Degree Audit (PDA) is an unofficial copy of a your academic progress. It tells you what you have taken, how it applies to the major in which you are interested, and what you have left to take. You can obtain a PDA from the kiosk on campus or via the my.fiu.edu website.</li>
<li>If you want to see how your courses apply to other majors you can do a "What If" selection for the appropriate major on the internet.</li>
<li>On the PDA, items that are marked OK next to the category means you have fulfilled the requirement. IP means you will complete the requirement this semester if you achieve the grade necessary for the course. NO means you still have to complete the requirement.</li>
<li>You should print out a PDA every semester to make certain your AP, IB or transfer credits appear, and they are fulfilling the proper requirements. Also, if your department adds new requirements, or makes any changes, you will become aware of those changes from your PDA.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your PDA is found in my.fiu.edu and you can also select the "What If" option to see what your requirements would be if you were to change your major.</p>
