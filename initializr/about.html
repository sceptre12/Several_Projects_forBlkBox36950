Learners will be introduced to Dr. Watson Swail’s model of Student Persistence and Achievement as well as a curricular approach to structuring student affairs programming efforts.

<!-- <p>Learning isn't just done inside the classroom but outside the classroom as well. Research has shown that student involvement promotes success. Students who get involved are more likely to graduate and have better grades and marketable skills. FIU encourages students to become global citizens by supporting differences and producing positive contributions to society. Campus involvement provides students with the opportunity to build new friendships, enhance networking abilities, acknowledge diversity, improve communications skills, acquire leadership skills, work as a team, and attain practical experience beneficial for personal development.</p>
